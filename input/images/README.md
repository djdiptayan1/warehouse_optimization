# Sample Images for Warehouse Optimization

Place your object images in this folder. The system will process each image to extract object dimensions.

## Supported Formats
- .jpg / .jpeg
- .png  
- .bmp

## Image Guidelines
1. **Clear boundaries**: Objects should have clear, distinct edges
2. **Good lighting**: Well-lit images work better for automatic detection
3. **Single object**: One object per image for best results
4. **Reference scale**: Consider including a reference object for calibration

## Example Files
You can add images like:
- box1.jpg (small cardboard box)
- container1.png (plastic container) 
- package1.jpeg (shipping package)

The system will prompt you for dimensions if automatic detection fails.
